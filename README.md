# node-red-contrib-zhpilot

This is a node introduction for the [ZHPILOT](www.zhpilot.com/)

ZHPILOT provides both a single-phase and three-phase energy meter. They are all bi-directional, din rail.
You can use them to meter the energy consumption.

[SPM91: Single Phase Energy Meter](https://www.zhpilot.com/din-rail-ac-single-phase-energy-meter-spm91-230v-63a-with-modbus-product/)

[SPM93: Three Phase Multifunction Energy Meter](https://www.zhpilot.com/din-rail-ac-three-phase-multifunction-energy-meter-spm93-for-measure-kwh-7-1-digits-lcd-display-with-modbus-protocol-product/)


## Installation

Install in Node-RED via the Manage Palette menu.

May also be installed via npm:

`npm install node-red-contrib-iammeter`
